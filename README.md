A simple web site for basic "web presence".  This web site is the web site
equivalent of handing a business card to someone.  It's purpose is simply to
give the recipient your name, what you do, how to contact you, and an optional
menu item for click-through to a web site if you wish.

You may relatively easily use this web site as a template, and modify it for
your own use.  To use it; download, install onto your web server, modify content
to customize as desired, enjoy.

There are no elaborate services required of your web server.  The only
requirements are that the server can deliver basic HTML/CSS and related asset
files.  The only browser requirements are basic HTML/CSS/Javascript/JQuery.
However, if proxies in your network prevent Internet access to CDN servers,
e.g., for font files, those fonts or other content may not render on the web
page as desired.

Installation, (the quick form):
  1.  Download the release version zip file of this project.
  2.  Unzip the files (keep sub-directory structure) somewhere into your
      public_html or equivalent HTTP server's document root.  You probably
      don't want to root it directly into your HTTP server's doc root; put it in
       a sub-dir by itself so it doesn't conflict with other existing/future
      web sites files.
  3.  Point your domain/sub-domain name, (or IP address), at the root directory of
      this web site.
  4.  Edit the index.html file for content; search for locations tagged with CEP,
      (common edit points), and change that content to what you wish, to customize
      it for yourself.
  5.  Optionally, replace the background.jpg file in the assets subdir with one of
      your choice.
  6.  If you don't wish to use the menu item which allows navigation to a web site,
      simply remove that related code in the index.html file.
